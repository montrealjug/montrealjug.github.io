Hello JUG members,

We would like to share an announcement about Devoxx US 2017 (in march)

We will receive soon a Free All Access Pass, that we will draw among the interested JUG members going to our next sessions.

Keep in touch!


__Official announcement__

Devoxx, the world’s largest vendor-neutral developer conference, is coming to North America.  Building off the very successful Devoxx conferences held annually in Antwerp, Paris, London, Krakow and Casablanca, Devoxx US 2017 will be held at the San Jose Convention Center March 21-23, 2017. 

The CFP is now open.  With 10 tracks and over 200 technical presentations planned, this will be the best event in North America for developers to share their passion.  The formats for technical talks range from full sessions, lightning talks, tools in action, BoFs, etc. 

The Program Committee, led by Devoxx founder Stephan Janssen, consists of “rock stars” in their respective technologies, and they are looking to seek out the best new speakers, especially from User Groups and JUGs from across North America. 

To submit your talk, or for more information, visit [http://cfp.devoxx.us/](http://cfp.devoxx.us/).  Hurry, because the CFP closes October 11.

We look forward to seeing you in San Jose!
The Devoxx US 2017 Team
