### Special event with the Software Crafter Committee!

This is our first event with the Software Crafter committee. We are joining forces to create a wonderful event where we discuss the entire software development chain with the Java Ecosystem.

#### The schedule:

#### 17:30 Greetings üçï

Meet people, network, eat, and chill before the event begins. It's a fantastic opportunity to get to know each other.

#### 18:00 - Introduction üíÅ

We regroup. Organizers give a short intro to the newcomers and we thank the host.

#### 18:10 - Quick Shares ‚ö°

Short presentations from the community. You can stand up and propose something if you want.
Typical intervention could be:

- I just want to say hi (3 seconds)
- I discovered this new tool, here's the website, you should check it out (1 minute)
- I've prepared a little presentation with a few slides (max. 10min)

#### 18:40 - Round-table discussion üí¨

Anyone can propose one or many subjects. We all vote on these topics and pick the ones with the most votes. Then we'll split into a few groups to discuss these.
You're free to stand up and change groups during the evening if you want to.
Examples of past topics:

- What is the ideal work setup for devs at work? (ex: local, cloud-based, hybrid, etc)
- AI code editors workflows + pros and cons
- What are the soft skills a good developer should have?
- Clean architecture VS feature-based architecture
- How you actually choose a backend technology?
- How to handle evolving of anemic model to DDD model ?
- Discussing how to prepare for and perform well on technical interviewers when job hunting.
- Monorepos: yay or nay? Pros, cons, tooling, and workflow

#### 19:40 - Recap' & closing

We regroup again. One person in each group does a short recap of what was discussed, so anyone gets a TL;DR of the different discussions.
Then we say goodbye and go home, full of joy and motivation until the next meetup.

See you there! üòÉ
