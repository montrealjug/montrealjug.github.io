Participez √† notre meetup de rentr√©e en Novembre ! En pr√©sentiel üéâ

Enabling applications to really thrive (and not just survive) in cloud environments can be challenging. The original 12 factor app methodology helped to lay out some of the key characteristics needed for cloud-native applications... but... as our cloud infrastructure and tooling has progressed, so too have these factors. In this workshop we'll dive into the extended and updated 15 factors needed to build cloud native applications that are able to thrive in this environment, and get hands-on with open source technologies and tools (including MicroProfile, Jakarta EE, Open Liberty, OpenJ9, and more!) that can help us achieve this.

L'√©v√®nement se d√©roulera dans les locaux de Go Logic , 5605, av. de Gasp√©, suite 704, Montr√©al QC H2T 2A4

Ouverture des portes : 17H30 et d√©but de l'√©v√©nement : 18 h !
