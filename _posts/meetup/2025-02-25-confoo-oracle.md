### 1. Using MySQL Document Store with Java

MySQL Document Store offers developers the best features of NoSQL and relational, SQL-based databases.

In this session, we will discuss how we can use Java to access a MySQL Document Store, create/remove collections, create/update/remove documents, retrieve, filter, & sort document lists, and leverage raw SQL to retrieve aggregate data for reporting purposes.

#### üé§ Speaker: Scott Stroz

Scott has been full-stack developer for longer than the term "full-stack developer" has been around. In that time, MySQL was the only constant in his development stack. 
He is passionate about sharing what he has learned on his coding journey so others may learn from his mistakes.

### 2. Connection Pooling in Java apps, the gotchas, and what‚Äôs important to know for a Java Application Developer

In this session, we look at the rationales behind pooling database connections, best practices, and common issues. 

We will explore connection pooling with a Spring Boot app, going from basic configurations to advanced features using Oracle‚Äôs UCP and Hikari CP. 

We will also look at what and how Oracle goes beyond with features like Application Continuity, Request Boundaries and more with Oracle UCP.

#### üé§ Speaker: Norman Japheth Aberin

Norman is a Developer Advocate in the Oracle Database team, with various exposures from full-stack development, developing a part of the Oracle Database Operator for Kubernetes, to creating resources on the new features of the Oracle JDBC driver and the Oracle Database, to working with low-code using Oracle APEX, and PL/SQL.
