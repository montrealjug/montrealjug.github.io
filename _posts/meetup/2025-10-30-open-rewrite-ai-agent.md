### AI Agents Writing OpenRewrite Recipes

Writing OpenRewrite recipes has never been easier with generative AI, enabling organizations to customize and build new recipes quickly that can then stamp out change across repos and apps. With custom recipe development cost trending toward zero the ability to codify and scale modernization patterns can expand rapidly.

This evolution opens the door to cross-industry collaboration, as seen in recent efforts like post-quantum cryptography (PQC) readiness. Several financial organizations are coming together to identify patterns and replacements for PQC that can then be codified into recipes that can be shared and enable sector-wide change. We'll share the foundations of the advanced program analysis techniques that have been expanded to solve for PQC and what potential that has for other applications from privacy and compliance to symbolic execution of tests.
