### Simpler Java Build Tools with Object Oriented Programming

The Java language is known to be performant, easy to use, and with great IDE support, but Java build tools like Maven or Gradle do not always live up to that reputation.

This talk will explore why build tooling is fundamentally such a difficult domain to work in, and how common concepts from object-oriented programming have the potential to simplify the build tool experience.

We will end with a demonstration of an experimental new Java build tool "Mill" that makes use of these ideas, proving out the idea that Java build tooling has the potential to be much faster, safer, and easier than it is today.

### Parlons s√©curit√© avec sbom et fichiers VEX

Ce sera une version alpha de ma pr√©sentation √† Devoxx Belgique et je profite du prochain JUG pour me pr√©parer et aussi tester mon contenu avec vous tous.

J'y aborderai les grands th√®mes: s√©curit√© de son code avec outils SAST, les containers distroless, et surtout les vuln√©rabilit√©s de ses d√©pendances et comment emp√™cher d'√™tre inond√© de CVEs!
