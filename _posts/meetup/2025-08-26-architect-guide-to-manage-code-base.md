### Architect's Guide to Managing a Code Base by Pratik Patel

As an architect you're often working at a high level on projects, thinking of architectural concerns such as distributed applications, CI/CD pipelines, inter-team APIs, and setting standards. Code quality affects everything that a software architect needs to work on - from a small way to a big way.

In this talk, we'll look at techniques and tools for managing code quality. Our goal as architects is to maximize the manageability of code, consider different coding paradigms and their effect on the six areas, and how to create habits and processes to ensure long term code viability. We'll take a couple of sidebars on performant vs manageable code and OO vs Data Oriented coding. We'll look at tools for doing static analysis vs dynamic analysis.
