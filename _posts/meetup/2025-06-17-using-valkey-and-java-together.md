### All you need to know about using Valkey and Java together !

In this session you‚Äôll learn about Valkey, a new Linux Foundation, open source, high-performance Key/Value database from both a technical and project perspective. First, the session will cover what triggered the fork from Redis and what the Valkey project aims to achieve. Then, we‚Äôll shift into learning how to interact with Valkey and how to best optimize storing data in the database. From that point we‚Äôll jump off into how Valkey interacts with your Java application, showing the pros and cons of various libraries. With that foundation, the talk will shift into Valkey‚Äôs new extended functionality: JSON, Bloom, and Vector Similarity Search. Finally, you‚Äôll find out how you can get involved with the project.
